# N-Queens Problem

The n-queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle and mathematical challenge.
It involves placing n chess queens on an n√ón chessboard in such a way that
no two queens threaten each other.
In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The challenge becomes increasingly complex as the size of the board (n) increases,
and finding a solution for larger values of n can be quite intricate.
The n-queens problem has applications in various fields such as computer science optimization, and artificial intelligence,
serving as a fundamental example for testing algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

## Solving the n-queens problem

The n-queens problem has been developed using Python programming language on Jupyter Notebook platform.

To run the program, use a python Jupyter Notebook IDE. That is, open the 'N-Queens Problem.ipynb' file using Jupyter Notebook.
